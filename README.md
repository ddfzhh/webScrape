# Weekly Box Office Email
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

### Description
This is my final project for CS50's Intro to Computer Science class. 

The goal of this project is to get data from [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com) and send an email weekly to my own email, with an HTML table showcasing the top 20 highest box office films of the week. 

## How to Use
### 1. Preparing the environment
When located to the directory, in command line type:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the libraries that are used in this project. 

### 2. Setting up email accounts
Open `helper.py`, and enter the email address for the `sender`and the `receiver`. You will also need to enter your `appPassword`, which is a password that apps can use to log into the sender's email account. 

You can find a tutorial on how to create a App Password for Gmail [here](https://www.lifewire.com/get-a-password-to-access-gmail-by-pop-imap-2-1171882).

You can enter multiple email addresses as a list for the `receiver` variable if you have multiple mailboxes that you would like to receive the email. 

### 3. Run the code! 
Run `main.py` and you will see the email in your mailbox in no time! 

### 4. Optional: Use task scheduler(for Windows system) to run the code every week.
You can utilize [task scheduler](https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-use-task-scheduler-on-windows) to send an email to yourself every week!
